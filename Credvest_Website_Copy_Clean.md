---

## SECTION 2: OPERATING MODEL

**Label:** How We Work
**Title:** One system. Four stages.

Every project runs through the same framework. Four stages, one team, full ownership.

---

**[ 01 ] Positioning**

Before anything goes to market, we define what the project stands for. Who it's for, how it's different, where it sits against everything else. Strategy before execution.

---

**[ 02 ] Marketing**

Brand, narrative, demand generation. Managed by the same team that set the positioning. The story stays consistent because nobody has to translate it secondhand.

---

**[ 03 ] Sales**

Dedicated teams, trained on your product, deployed to your project. Sales is a system here. Structured, tracked, reviewed. Not dependent on who happens to be on shift.

---

**[ 04 ] Execution**

Real-time tracking. Weekly reviews. Full visibility into what's moving and what's stalled. Operational rigour that makes a sales mandate predictable.

## SECTION 4: WHY PROJECTS LOSE VELOCITY

**Title:** Why projects lose velocity.

Most projects don't underperform because of the product. They underperform because the system behind the sale was never properly built.

---

**01 — Pre-Launch Misalignment**

Too many vendors. Too many narratives. By the time the project reaches the market, the first impression is already compromised.

---

**02 — Fragmented Ownership**

When branding, marketing, and sales sit with different teams carrying different incentives, the buyer experience fractures. Nobody owns the full picture.

---

**03 — Experience Gaps**

What the collateral promises and what the buyer encounters on the ground don't match. That gap is where trust is lost. Deals follow.

---

## SECTION 5: WHY DEVELOPERS CHOOSE CREDVEST

**Title:** Why developers choose Credvest.

Built by people who have spent years inside real estate operations.

---

**Your Brand, Our Team**

Our people carry the developer's identity, not ours. Every interaction a buyer has feels like the developer's organisation. We stay out of the picture. By design.

---

**Process Over Personality**

Every stage of the sales cycle has a defined framework. Performance is tracked, reviewed, improved. Results come from the system, not from hoping the right person is in the room.

---

**Dedicated Teams**

Each mandate gets its own people. Aligned to the project, embedded in the product, accountable to the numbers. Not rotated. Not shared.

---

## SECTION 6: SINGLE-POINT ACCOUNTABILITY

**Title:** Single-Point Accountability

Most developers coordinate four or five vendors to take a project to market. Each runs its own process. Each reports on its own terms.

We replace that with one team. Positioning, marketing, sales, execution. One reporting line, one set of standards. When something needs to change, it changes the same week.

- Sales treated as an operational discipline
- Dedicated teams on every project
- Real-time performance tracking
- Partnerships built on outcomes

---

## SECTION 7: PERFORMANCE ACROSS ACTIVE MANDATES

**Title:** Measured outcomes.

---

**Bangalore**

- **100+ Projects Served.** Residential and mixed-use developments across key micro-markets.
- **₹4,200+ Cr in Transactions.** Across structured sales and exclusive mandates.
- **3.2x Sales Velocity Improvement.** What structured operations look like in practice.

**Hyderabad**

- Active and expanding. City data available on request.

---

## SECTION 8: SALES IS CONSULTING

**Title:** Sales is consulting.
**Subtitle:** Guiding decisions, not moving inventory.

Buying property is a considered decision. The person a buyer meets should be able to hold a serious conversation about the product, the market, and the purchase itself. Our teams are trained to consult, not to close. Trust converts better than pressure.

---

*"Our focus isn't just on selling. It's on guiding clients through their decision as consultants, not salespeople."*
— Bhavya, GM, Sales

*"What sets this apart is how marketing, sales, and operations actually function as one system."*
— Neeti A, AGM, Marketing

*"Pipeline visibility isn't a reporting feature. It's how better decisions get made."*
— Roopesh, Direct Sales

---

## SECTION 10: COMMON QUESTIONS

**Title:** Common Questions

---

**Q: How does Credvest work with developers?**
As an extension of the developer's own team. We manage the sales lifecycle from positioning through to closure, replacing what would otherwise be three or four separate vendors.

**Q: Is Credvest a brokerage?**
No. Sales here is built as an operational system. Dedicated teams, defined processes, real-time accountability. A different model entirely.

**Q: Do your teams represent the developer's brand?**
Yes. The buyer's experience is entirely within the developer's brand. Our involvement is behind the scenes.

**Q: What cities are you in?**
Bangalore and Hyderabad. Deep micro-market expertise in both.

**Q: How do you track performance?**
Live pipeline data, weekly reviews, structured reporting. Developers see what's happening in real time, not in a monthly summary.

**Q: What kinds of projects do you take on?**
Residential and commercial, at varying scales. We configure team size and systems to match the mandate.

**Q: Do I need a real estate background to join?**
No. We look for clear thinking, ownership, and the willingness to learn quickly. The industry knowledge is built here.

## OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

**Title:** One partner for the entire journey.

Taking a project from readiness to sell-out requires sustained coordination across positioning, marketing, sales, and operations. Most developers manage this across multiple vendors, each working independently.

Credvest consolidates that into a single mandate. One team. One system. Full accountability.

- Sales as an operational discipline
- Dedicated project teams
- Real-time performance visibility
- Partnerships built on outcomes
